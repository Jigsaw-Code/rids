"""
Generalizes the various formats of IOCs into a common class, RuleSet.
RuleSet is a value type that represents evaluation on packets and connections.
It can be constructed from one of the flavors of parsers in `rids.iocs` or
merged from combining a pair of RuleSet instances.  Its constructor takes a
dict (or equivalent) argument that mirrors the tree-like structure of its
combined rules, for ease of creating new IOC decoders and when testing.
Evaluation of the RuleSet is done with the process_connection(...) and
process_packet(...) which take appropriate context objects and produce a
list of zero or more Event instances from matching rules in the RuleSet.
